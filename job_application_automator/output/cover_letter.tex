You can replace the signature image and the dummy text with your own.

Please note that this is just a template and you should customize it to fit your specific needs and the job you are applying for.

Also, make sure to compile the LaTeX document with the `--shell-escape` flag to allow the inclusion of images, as follows:
```
$ pdflatex --shell-escape coverletter.tex
```
This will generate a PDF file named `coverletter.pdf`.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
